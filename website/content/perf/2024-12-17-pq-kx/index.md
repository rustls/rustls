To defend against the potential advent of "Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers"
there is a move to using "hybrid" key exchange algorithms.  These glue together
a widely-deployed classical algorithm (like [X25519]) and a new post-quantum-secure algorithm
(like [ML-KEM]) and treat the result as one TLS-level key exchange algorithm (like [X25519MLKEM768]).

In this report, first we'll measure the additional cost of post-quantum-secure key exchange.
Then we'll describe and measure an optimization we have implemented.

# Headline measurements

All these measurements are taken on our amd64 benchmarking machine, which has a
[Xeon E-2386G] CPU.  We'll compare:

- rustls using post-quantum-insecure X25519 key exchange,
- rustls using post-quantum-secure X25519MLKEM768 key exchange, and
- OpenSSL 3.3.2 using post-quantum-insecure X25519 key exchange.

All three are taken on the same hardware, and the latter measurements are from
[our previous report](@/perf/2024-10-18-report.md) -- which also contains reproduction
instructions and describes what the benchmarks measure.

One important thing to note is that post-quantum key exchange involves sending and
receiving much larger messages than classical ones.  Our benchmark design only covers
CPU costs -- and does not include networking -- so real-world performance will
be worse than these measurements.

The cost of X25519MLKEM768 post-quantum key exchange is clearly visible for
both clients and servers.

We can see that the performance headroom that rustls has attained means we can _almost_
completely absorb the extra cost of post-quantum key exchange, while still performing
better than (post-quantum-insecure) OpenSSL -- with the exception of client resumption.

We will do further comparative benchmarking in this area when OpenSSL gains post-quantum key
exchange support.

# Sharing X25519 setup costs

## Background

In TLS1.3, the client starts the key exchange in its first message (the `ClientHello`).
The `ClientHello` includes both a description of which algorithms the client supports, and
zero or more presumptive "key shares".

The server then evaluates which algorithms it is willing to use, and either uses one
of the presumptive key shares, or replies with a `HelloRetryRequest` which instructs
the client to send new `ClientHello` with a specific, mutually-acceptable key share.

A `HelloRetryRequest` can be expensive, because it introduces an additional round trip
into the handshake.  It also means any work the client did for its presumptive key
shares is wasted.

It's therefore advantageous for a client to avoid `HelloRetryRequest`s, by:

- **Having prior knowledge of the server's preferences.**  [draft-ietf-tls-key-share-prediction]
  is an effort to standardize a mechanism for a client to learn this out-of-band.

- **Remembering a server's preferences from a previous connection.**  rustls has
  done this since adding support for TLS1.3 in 2017.  This generally means
  a client making many connections to one server may avoid repeated `HelloRetryRequest`s.

- **Sending many presumptive key shares.** Though there's an obvious trade-off
  in terms of wasted computation and message size.

- **Following ecosystem preferences.** [X25519] key exchange is overwhelmingly
  preferred in TLS1.3 implementations, due to its performance and implementation
  quality.

The key shares in a `ClientHello` would look like:

At least for a transitional period, we want to avoid a `HelloRetryRequest` round
trip when connecting to a server that hasn't been upgraded to support X25519MLKEM768.
That means also offering a separate X25519 key share:

![diagram of TLS1.3 client key exchange with X25519MLKEM768 and X25519](hybrid-both.svg)

However, this arrangement is not optimal.  While X25519 setup is very fast, we are doing it twice
and then we are guaranteed to throw away half of that work, because the server can only ever select
one key share to use.

Instead, we can do:

![diagram of TLS1.3 optimized client key exchange with X25519MLKEM768 and X25519](hybrid-opt.svg)

This report measures the benefit of that optimization.

This optimization is described further in [draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design] section 3.2.

## Micro benchmarking

First, we can micro-benchmark the time to construct and serialize a `ClientHello`, in a variety
of situations:

- X25519 key share included only.
- X25519MLKEM768 and X25519 key shares, with the optimization.
- X25519MLKEM768 and X25519 key shares, without the optimization.

We run this on two machines that cover both amd64 (Xeon E-2386G) and aarch64 (Ampere Altra Q80-30)
architectures.

![micro benchmark results on amd64 architecture](microbench-amd64.svg)

![micro benchmark results on arm64 architecture](microbench-arm64.svg)

From this we can see:

- There is a small but measurable benefit, as expected.
- ML-KEM-768 key generation costs are significantly more expensive than X25519.

## Whole handshakes

Next, let's measure the same scenarios in the context of whole client handshakes.
The remaining measurements are only done on our amd64 benchmark machine.

The above optimization only affects the client's first message, so now we'll see
whether the effect of the optimization is meaningful when compared to the rest
of the computation a client must do.

The difference is visible but small, as it has been diluted by other parts
of the handshake.  It is approximately 4.3% for resumptions,
2.8% for full RSA handshakes, and 2.6% for ECDSA handshakes.
