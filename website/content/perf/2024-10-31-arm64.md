title = "Benchmarking rustls 0.23.15 vs OpenSSL 3.3.2 vs BoringSSL on ARM64"
date = 2024-10-31
+++

### System configuration

We ran the benchmarks on a bare-metal server with the following characteristics:

- OS: Debian 12 (Bookworm).
- C/C++ toolchains: GCC 12.2.0 and Clang 14.0.6.
- CPU: Ampere Altra Q80-30, 80 cores.
- Memory: 128GB.
- All cores set to `performance` CPU frequency governor.

This is the [Hetzner RX170](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/matrix-rx/).

### Versions
The benchmarking tool used for both OpenSSL and BoringSSL was [openssl-bench d5de57d9](https://github.com/ctz/openssl-bench/tree/d5de57d92d483169cabf8ec22c351fe3819ba656).

This was built from source with its makefile.

#### BoringSSL
The tested version of BoringSSL is [76968bb3d5](https://github.com/google/boringssl/tree/76968bb3d5), which was the most recent point on master
when we started [the previous measurements](@/perf/2024-10-18-report.md).

BoringSSL was built from source with `CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
clang is used here to [avoid potential performance deficits to GCC](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/42290529)
and for consistency with the x86 results.

#### OpenSSL
The tested version of OpenSSL is [3.3.2](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/tree/openssl-3.3.2), which was the latest release at the time of writing.

OpenSSL was built from source with `./Configure ; make -j12`.

#### Rustls
The tested version of rustls was 0.23.15, which was the latest release at the time of writing.
This was used with aws-lc-rs 1.10.0 / aws-lc-sys 0.22.0.

Additionally the following two commits were included, which affect the benchmark tool but do not affect the core crate:

- [13144a0a](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/13144a0aa391bbec55aa92ee020e88c2bb8c3ea8)
- [b553880a](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/b553880a5f5caf58bbd2c43e4031e8c55d6da486)

### Measurements

BoringSSL was tested with this command:

```shell
~/bench/openssl-bench
$ BENCH_MULTIPLIER=16 setarch -R make measure BORINGSSL=1
```

OpenSSL was tested with this command:

```shell
~/bench/openssl-bench
$ BENCH_MULTIPLIER=16 setarch -R make measure
```

rustls was tested with this command:

```shell
~/bench/rustls
$ BENCH_MULTIPLIER=16 setarch -R make -f admin/bench-measure.mk measure
```

## Results

Transfer measurements are in megabytes per second.
Handshake units are handshakes per second.

### Observations on results

rustls trails a little in throughput tests.  The three underlying
cryptography libraries (BoringSSL, aws-lc, OpenSSL) have their own
benchmarking tools which confirm that there is little variance between
them:

```shell
~/bench/boringssl
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./tool/bssl speed -filter AES-256-GCM
(...)
Did 139000 AES-256-GCM (16384 bytes) seal operations in 1004138us (138427.2 ops/sec): 2268.0 MB/s
(...)
```

```shell
~/bench/aws-lc
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./tool/bssl speed -filter AES-256-GCM
(...)
Did 139000 EVP-AES-256-GCM encrypt (16384 bytes) operations in 1004522us (138374.3 ops/sec): 2267.1 MB/s
(...)
```

```shell
~/bench/openssl
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./apps/openssl speed -aead -evp aes-256-gcm
(...)
Doing AES-256-GCM ops for 3s on 16384 size blocks: 434715 AES-256-GCM ops in 3.00s
(...)
The 'numbers' are in 1000s of bytes per second processed.
type              2 bytes     31 bytes    136 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes  16384 bytes
AES-256-GCM      13570.29k   168865.38k   623050.41k  1766296.58k  2320760.83k  2374123.52k
```

That is 2268, 2267 and 2264 MB/s for BoringSSL, aws-lc and OpenSSL respectively.
Given these project's shared lineage, it would not be surprising if the implementations
are the same.
