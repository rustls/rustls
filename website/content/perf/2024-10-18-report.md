### System configuration

We ran the benchmarks on a bare-metal server with the following characteristics:

- OS: Debian 12 (Bookworm).
- C/C++ toolchains: GCC 12.2.0 and Clang 14.0.6.
- CPU: [Xeon E-2386G](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/214806/intel-xeon-e2386g-processor-12m-cache-3-50-ghz/specifications.html) (supporting AVX-512).
- Memory: 32GB.
- Extra configuration: hyper-threading disabled, dynamic frequency scaling disabled, cpu scaling
  governor set to performance for all cores.

### Versions
The benchmarking tool used for both OpenSSL and BoringSSL was [openssl-bench d5de57d9](https://github.com/ctz/openssl-bench/tree/d5de57d92d483169cabf8ec22c351fe3819ba656).

This was built from source with its makefile.

#### BoringSSL
The tested version of BoringSSL is [76968bb3d5](https://github.com/google/boringssl/tree/76968bb3d5), which was the most recent point on master
when we started these measurements.

BoringSSL was built from source with `CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
clang is used here to [avoid potential performance deficits to GCC](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/42290529).

#### OpenSSL
The tested version of OpenSSL is [3.3.2](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/tree/openssl-3.3.2), which was the latest release at the time of writing.

OpenSSL was built from source with `./Configure ; make -j12`.

#### Rustls
The tested version of rustls was 0.23.15, which was the latest release at the time of writing.
This was used with aws-lc-rs 1.10.0 / aws-lc-sys 0.22.0.

Additionally the following two commits were included, which affect the benchmark tool but do not affect the core crate:

- [13144a0a](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/13144a0aa391bbec55aa92ee020e88c2bb8c3ea8)
- [b553880a](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/b553880a5f5caf58bbd2c43e4031e8c55d6da486)

### Measurements

BoringSSL was tested with this command:

```shell
~/bench/openssl-bench
$ BENCH_MULTIPLIER=16 setarch -R make measure BORINGSSL=1
```

OpenSSL was tested with this command:

```shell
~/bench/openssl-bench
$ BENCH_MULTIPLIER=16 setarch -R make measure
```

rustls was tested with this command:

```shell
~/bench/rustls
$ BENCH_MULTIPLIER=16 setarch -R make -f admin/bench-measure.mk measure
```

## Results

Transfer measurements are in megabytes per second.
Handshake units are handshakes per second.

### Observations on results

AVX-512 support shows up twice in these results:

- rustls/aws-lc and OpenSSL's performance advantage in throughput tests is due to use of AVX-512F/VAES.
- rustls/aws-lc and OpenSSL's performance advantage in server-side full handshake tests is due to use of AVX-512IFMA-accelerated RSA.

This support was contributed to the respective projects by Intel.

TLS1.3 resumption is slower than TLS1.2 resumption because it includes a fresh key exchange.
