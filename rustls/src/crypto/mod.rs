/// Controls core cryptography used by rustls.
///
/// This crate comes with two built-in options, provided as
/// `&dyn CryptoProvider` values:
///
/// - [`crate::crypto::ring::RING`]: (behind the `ring` crate feature, which
///   is enabled by default).  This provider uses the [*ring*](https://github.com/briansmith/ring)
///   crate.
/// - [`crate::crypto::aws_lc_rs::AWS_LC_RS`]: (behind the `aws_lc_rs` feature,
///   which is optional).  This provider uses the [aws-lc-rs](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs)
///   crate.
///
/// This trait provides defaults. Everything in it, other than randomness, can be overridden at
/// runtime by methods on [`ConfigBuilder`](crate::ConfigBuilder).
///
/// # Using a specific `CryptoProvider`
///
/// Supply the provider when constructing your [`crate::ClientConfig`] or [`crate::ServerConfig`]:
///
/// - [`crate::ClientConfig::builder_with_provider()`]
/// - [`crate::ServerConfig::builder_with_provider()`]
///
/// When creating and configuring a webpki-backed client or server certificate verifier, a choice of
/// provider is also needed to start the configuration process:
///
/// - [`crate::client::WebPkiServerVerifier::builder_with_provider()`]
/// - [`crate::server::WebPkiClientVerifier::builder_with_provider()`]
///
/// # Making a custom `CryptoProvider`
///
/// Naturally start with a type that implements [`crate::crypto::CryptoProvider`].
///
/// ## Which elements are required?
///
/// There is no requirement that the individual elements (`SupportedCipherSuite`, `SupportedKxGroup`,
/// `SigningKey`, etc.) come from the same crate.  It is allowed and expected that uninteresting
/// elements would be delegated back to one of the default providers (statically) or a parent
/// provider (dynamically).
///
/// For example, if we want to make a provider that just overrides key loading in the config builder
/// API ([`crate::ConfigBuilder::with_single_cert`] etc.), it might look like this:
///
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(feature = "ring")] {
/// # use std::sync::Arc;
/// # mod fictious_hsm_api { pub fn load_private_key(key_der: pki_types::PrivateKeyDer<'static>) -> ! { unreachable!(); } }
/// use rustls::crypto::ring::RING;
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// struct HsmKeyLoader;
///
/// impl rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider for HsmKeyLoader {///
///     fn default_cipher_suites(&self) -> &'static [rustls::SupportedCipherSuite] {
///         RING.default_cipher_suites()
///     }
///
///     fn default_kx_groups(&self) -> &'static [&'static dyn rustls::crypto::SupportedKxGroup] {
///         RING.default_kx_groups()
///     }
///
///     fn signature_verification_algorithms(&self) -> rustls::crypto::WebPkiSupportedAlgorithms {
///         RING.signature_verification_algorithms()
///     }
///
///     fn secure_random(&self) -> &'static dyn rustls::crypto::SecureRandom {
///        &HsmKeyLoader
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl rustls::crypto::SecureRandom for HsmKeyLoader {
///     fn fill(&self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), rustls::crypto::GetRandomFailed> {
///         RING.secure_random().fill(buf)
///     }
/// }
///

///     fn load_private_key(&self, key_der: pki_types::PrivateKeyDer<'static>) -> Result<Arc<dyn rustls::sign::SigningKey>, rustls::Error> {

///     }

/// # }
/// ```
///

///
/// The elements are documented separately:
///
/// - **Random** - see [`crate::crypto::CryptoProvider::fill()`].
/// - **Cipher suites** - see [`crate::SupportedCipherSuite`], [`crate::Tls12CipherSuite`], and
///   [`crate::Tls13CipherSuite`].

/// - **Signature verification algorithms** - see [`crate::crypto::WebPkiSupportedAlgorithms`].
