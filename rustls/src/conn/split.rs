//! A split reader-writer interface.
//!
//! This module offers an alternative API for TLS connections with completed
//! handshakes.  It separates the read and write halves of the connection into
//! [`Reader`] and [`Writer`] respectively.  These halves can be used fairly
//! independently, making it easier to pipeline and maximize throughput.
