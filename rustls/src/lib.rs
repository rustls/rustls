//! # Rustls - a modern TLS library
//!
//! Rustls is a TLS library that aims to provide a good level of cryptographic security,
//! requires no configuration to achieve that security, and provides no unsafe features or
//! obsolete cryptography by default.
//!
//! Rustls implements TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 for both clients and servers. See [the full
//! list of protocol features](manual::_04_features).
//!
//! ### Platform support
//!
//! While Rustls itself is platform independent, by default it uses [`aws-lc-rs`] for implementing
//! the cryptography in TLS.  See [the aws-lc-rs FAQ][aws-lc-rs-platforms-faq] for more details of the
//! platform/architecture support constraints in aws-lc-rs.
//!
//! [`ring`] is also available via the `ring` crate feature: see
//! [the supported `ring` target platforms][ring-target-platforms].
//!
//! By providing a custom instance of the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] struct, you
//! can replace all cryptography dependencies of rustls.  This is a route to being portable
//! to a wider set of architectures and environments, or compliance requirements.  See the
//! [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] documentation for more details.
//!
//! Specifying `default-features = false` when depending on rustls will remove the implicit
//! dependency on aws-lc-rs.
//!
//! Rustls requires Rust 1.71 or later. It has an optional dependency on zlib-rs which requires 1.75 or later.
//!

//! [`aws-lc-rs`]: https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs
//!
//! ### Cryptography providers
//!
//! Since Rustls 0.22 it has been possible to choose the provider of the cryptographic primitives
//! that Rustls uses. This may be appealing if you have specific platform, compliance or feature
//! requirements that aren't met by the default provider, [`aws-lc-rs`].
//!
//! Users that wish to customize the provider in use can do so when constructing `ClientConfig`
//! and `ServerConfig` instances using the `with_crypto_provider` method on the respective config
//! builder types. See the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] documentation for more details.
//!
//! #### Built-in providers
//!
//! Rustls ships with two built-in providers controlled by associated crate features:
//!
//!   * [`aws-lc-rs`] - enabled by default, available with the `aws_lc_rs` crate feature enabled.
//!   * [`ring`] - available with the `ring` crate feature enabled.
//!
//! See the documentation for [`crypto::CryptoProvider`] for details on how providers are
//! selected.
//!
//! #### Third-party providers
//!
//! The community has also started developing third-party providers for Rustls:
//!
//!   * [`boring-rustls-provider`] - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`boringssl`] for
//!     cryptography.
//!   * [`rustls-graviola`] - a provider that uses [`graviola`] for cryptography.
//!   * [`rustls-mbedtls-provider`] - a provider that uses [`mbedtls`] for cryptography.
//!   * [`rustls-openssl`] - a provider that uses [OpenSSL] for cryptography.
//!   * [`rustls-rustcrypto`] - an experimental provider that uses the crypto primitives
//!     from [`RustCrypto`] for cryptography.
//!   * [`rustls-symcrypt`] - a provider that uses Microsoft's [SymCrypt] library.
//!   * [`rustls-wolfcrypt-provider`] - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`wolfCrypt`] for cryptography.

//! We also provide a simple example of writing your own provider in the [custom provider example].
//! This example implements a minimal provider using parts of the [`RustCrypto`] ecosystem.
//!
//! See the [Making a custom CryptoProvider] section of the documentation for more information
//! on this topic.

//!
//! ## Design overview
//!
//! Rustls is a low-level library. If your goal is to make HTTPS connections you may prefer
//! to use a library built on top of Rustls like [hyper] or [ureq].
//!
//! [hyper]: https://crates.io/crates/hyper
//! [ureq]: https://crates.io/crates/ureq
//!
//! ### Rustls does not take care of network IO
//! It doesn't make or accept TCP connections, or do DNS, or read or write files.
//!
//! Our [examples] directory contains demos that show how to handle I/O using the
//! [`stream::Stream`] helper, as well as more complex asynchronous I/O using [`mio`].
//! If you're already using Tokio for an async runtime you may prefer to use [`tokio-rustls`] instead
//! of interacting with rustls directly.
//!
//! [examples]: https://github.com/rustls/rustls/tree/main/examples
//! [`tokio-rustls`]: https://github.com/rustls/tokio-rustls
//!
//! ### Rustls provides encrypted pipes
//! These are the [`ServerConnection`] and [`ClientConnection`] types.  You supply raw TLS traffic
//! on the left (via the [`read_tls()`] and [`write_tls()`] methods) and then read/write the
//! plaintext on the right:
//!
//! [`read_tls()`]: Connection::read_tls
//! [`write_tls()`]: Connection::read_tls
//!
//! ```text
//!          TLS                                   Plaintext
//!          ===                                   =========
//!     read_tls()      +-----------------------+      reader() as io::Read
//!                     |                       |
//!           +--------->   ClientConnection    +--------->
//!                     |          or           |
//!           <---------+   ServerConnection    <---------+
//!                     |                       |
//!     write_tls()     +-----------------------+      writer() as io::Write
//! ```
//!
//! ### Rustls takes care of server certificate verification
//! You do not need to provide anything other than a set of root certificates to trust.
//! Certificate verification cannot be turned off or disabled in the main API.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//! This is the minimum you need to do to make a TLS client connection.
//!
//! First we load some root certificates.  These are used to authenticate the server.
//! The simplest way is to depend on the [`webpki_roots`] crate which contains
//! the Mozilla set of root certificates.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "aws-lc-rs")] {
//! let root_store = rustls::RootCertStore::from_iter(
//!     webpki_roots::TLS_SERVER_ROOTS
//!         .iter()
//!         .cloned(),
//! );
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! [`webpki_roots`]: https://crates.io/crates/webpki-roots
//!
//! Next, we make a `ClientConfig`.  You're likely to make one of these per process,
//! and use it for all connections made by that process.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "aws_lc_rs")] {
//! # let root_store: rustls::RootCertStore = panic!();
//! let config = rustls::ClientConfig::builder()
//!     .with_root_certificates(root_store)
//!     .with_no_client_auth();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Now we can make a connection.  You need to provide the server's hostname so we
//! know what to expect to find in the server's certificate.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature = "aws_lc_rs")] {
//! # use rustls;
//! # use webpki;
//! # use std::sync::Arc;
//! # rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider().install_default();
//! # let root_store = rustls::RootCertStore::from_iter(
//! #  webpki_roots::TLS_SERVER_ROOTS
//! #      .iter()
//! #      .cloned(),
//! # );
//! # let config = rustls::ClientConfig::builder()
//! #     .with_root_certificates(root_store)
//! #     .with_no_client_auth();
//! let rc_config = Arc::new(config);
//! let example_com = "example.com".try_into().unwrap();
//! let mut client = rustls::ClientConnection::new(rc_config, example_com);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Now you should do appropriate IO for the `client` object.  If `client.wants_read()` yields
//! true, you should call `client.read_tls()` when the underlying connection has data.
//! Likewise, if `client.wants_write()` yields true, you should call `client.write_tls()`
//! when the underlying connection is able to send data.  You should continue doing this
//! as long as the connection is valid.
//!
//! The return types of `read_tls()` and `write_tls()` only tell you if the IO worked.  No
//! parsing or processing of the TLS messages is done.  After each `read_tls()` you should
//! therefore call `client.process_new_packets()` which parses and processes the messages.
//! Any error returned from `process_new_packets` is fatal to the connection, and will tell you
//! why.  For example, if the server's certificate is expired `process_new_packets` will
//! return `Err(InvalidCertificate(Expired))`.  From this point on,
//! `process_new_packets` will not do any new work and will return that error continually.
//!
//! You can extract newly received data by calling `client.reader()` (which implements the
//! `io::Read` trait).  You can send data to the peer by calling `client.writer()` (which
//! implements `io::Write` trait).  Note that `client.writer().write()` buffers data you
//! send if the TLS connection is not yet established: this is useful for writing (say) a
//! HTTP request, but this is buffered so avoid large amounts of data.
//!
//! The following code uses a fictional socket IO API for illustration, and does not handle
//! errors.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # #[cfg(feature = "aws_lc_rs")] {
//! # let mut client = rustls::ClientConnection::new(panic!(), panic!()).unwrap();
//! # struct Socket { }
//! # impl Socket {
//! #   fn ready_for_write(&self) -> bool { false }
//! #   fn ready_for_read(&self) -> bool { false }
//! #   fn wait_for_something_to_happen(&self) { }
//! # }
//! #
//! # use std::io::{Read, Write, Result};
//! # impl Read for Socket {
//! #   fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<usize> { panic!() }
//! # }
//! # impl Write for Socket {
//! #   fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize> { panic!() }
//! #   fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<()> { panic!() }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn connect(_address: &str, _port: u16) -> Socket {
//! #   panic!();
//! # }
//! use std::io;
//! use rustls::Connection;
//!
//! client.writer().write(b"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n").unwrap();
//! let mut socket = connect("example.com", 443);
//! loop {
//!   if client.wants_read() && socket.ready_for_read() {
//!     client.read_tls(&mut socket).unwrap();
//!     client.process_new_packets().unwrap();
//!
//!     let mut plaintext = Vec::new();
//!     client.reader().read_to_end(&mut plaintext).unwrap();
//!     io::stdout().write(&plaintext).unwrap();
//!   }
//!
//!   if client.wants_write() && socket.ready_for_write() {
//!     client.write_tls(&mut socket).unwrap();
//!   }
//!
//!   socket.wait_for_something_to_happen();
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! You can find several client and server examples of varying complexity in the [examples]
//! directory, including [`tlsserver-mio`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/blob/main/examples/src/bin/tlsserver-mio.rs)
//! and [`tlsclient-mio`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/blob/main/examples/src/bin/tlsclient-mio.rs)

//! # Manual
//!
//! The [rustls manual](crate::manual) explains design decisions and includes how-to guidance.
//!
//! # Crate features
//! Here's a list of what features are exposed by the rustls crate and what
//! they mean.
//!
//! - `std` (enabled by default): enable the high-level (buffered) Connection API and other functionality
//!   which relies on the `std` library.
//!
//! - `aws_lc_rs` (enabled by default): makes the rustls crate depend on the [`aws-lc-rs`] crate.
//!   Use `rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider().install_default()` to
//!   use it as the default `CryptoProvider`, or provide it explicitly
//!   when making a `ClientConfig` or `ServerConfig`.
//!
//!   Note that aws-lc-rs has additional build-time dependencies like cmake.
//!   See [the documentation](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/requirements/index.html) for details.
//!
//! - `ring`: makes the rustls crate depend on the *ring* crate for cryptography.
//!   Use `rustls::crypto::ring::default_provider().install_default()` to
//!   use it as the default `CryptoProvider`, or provide it explicitly
//!   when making a `ClientConfig` or `ServerConfig`.
//!
//! - `fips`: enable support for FIPS140-3-approved cryptography, via the [`aws-lc-rs`] crate.
//!   This feature enables the `aws_lc_rs` crate feature, which makes the rustls crate depend
//!   on [aws-lc-rs](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs).  It also changes the default
//!   for [`ServerConfig::require_ems`] and [`ClientConfig::require_ems`].
//!
//!   See [manual::_06_fips] for more details.
//!
//! - `prefer-post-quantum` (enabled by default): for the [`aws-lc-rs`]-backed provider,
//!   prioritizes post-quantum secure key exchange by default (using X25519MLKEM768).
//!   This feature merely alters the order of `rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::DEFAULT_KX_GROUPS`.
//!   See [the manual][x25519mlkem768-manual] for more details.
//!
//! - `custom-provider`: disables implicit use of built-in providers (`aws-lc-rs` or `ring`). This forces
//!   applications to manually install one, for instance, when using a custom `CryptoProvider`.
//!
//! - `tls12` (enabled by default): enable support for TLS version 1.2. Note that, due to the
//!   additive nature of Cargo features and because it is enabled by default, other crates
//!   in your dependency graph could re-enable it for your application. If you want to disable
//!   TLS 1.2 for security reasons, consider explicitly enabling TLS 1.3 only in the config
//!   builder API.
//!
//! - `logging` (enabled by default): make the rustls crate depend on the `log` crate.
//!   rustls outputs interesting protocol-level messages at `trace!` and `debug!` level,
//!   and protocol-level errors at `warn!` and `error!` level.  The log messages do not
//!   contain secret key data, and so are safe to archive without affecting session security.
//!
//! - `read_buf`: when building with Rust Nightly, adds support for the unstable
//!   `std::io::ReadBuf` and related APIs. This reduces costs from initializing
//!   buffers. Will do nothing on non-Nightly releases.
//!
//! - `brotli`: uses the `brotli` crate for RFC8879 certificate compression support.
//!
//! - `zlib`: uses the `zlib-rs` crate for RFC8879 certificate compression support.
//!
