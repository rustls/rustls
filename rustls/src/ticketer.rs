        //  3. unlock mutex and generate new ticketer.

        //
        // There are a few things to note here. First, we don't check whether

        // necessary.

        // This somewhat convoluted approach ensures good availability of the
        // mutex, by ensuring that the state is usable and the mutex not held
        // during generation. It also ensures that, so long as the inner
