<!--
Please note that we are only interested in **semver-incompatible** update requests. Updates to dependencies that are
semver-compatible can be done in dependent projects without needing changes in this repository.

For example, if you are here because you believe Rustls is bringing in dependency `foo` at version `0.2.1` and
you wish Rustls used `0.2.2` instead, you should not file an issue and instead should run `cargo update` in your
dependent project. It would only be appropriate to file an issue if you require Rustls use `foo` at version `0.3.0+`.
