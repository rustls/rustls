# rustls-post-quantum

The functionality of this crate became part of the core rustls
crate from the 0.23.22 release. When using that version of the crate,
use the `prefer-post-quantum` Cargo feature to control whether to prefer
using post-quantum algorithms instead of using this crate.

This crate is release under the same licenses as the [main rustls crate][rustls].
